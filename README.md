 Hi there, I'm Sal Kimmich  
</h1>
:signal_strength:✨:earth_americas:✨:computer:✨:globe_with_meridians:

I'm a cybersecurity and infrastructure strategist with over a decade of experience leading secure computing initiatives, AI safety systems, and privacy-enhancing technology projects across open source, public sector, and deep-tech startups.

I currently serve as **Technical Director of GadflyAI**, where I lead ethical infrastructure projects at the intersection of AI, privacy, and digital sovereignty. Previously, I was **Technical Community Architect** at the Linux Foundation’s **Confidential Computing Consortium**, supporting trusted execution environments (TEEs), secure workload identity, and open standards for runtime attestation.

🔐 My focus: secure-by-design systems that scale — for governments, startups, and the future of agentic AI.

## 💫 Before You Go

Here’s a spoken word poem I love — [*The Pragmatist's Guide to Magic*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA7LPK2iHq4). May it remind you to build systems with both resilience and wonder.
