## Hi there, I'm Sal Kimmich 
# :signal_strength:‚ú®:earth_americas:‚ú®:computer:‚ú®:globe_with_meridians:

<br />

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a decade of experience in reinforcement learning, predictive analytics, and algorithmic efficiency for cloud computing. 

I care about the human-centered management of data-driven systems, helping people build data ecosystems that make sense, and solving hard problems through the clever use of math.
