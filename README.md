## Hi there, I'm Sal Kimmich 
# :signal_strength:‚ú®:earth_americas:‚ú®:computer:‚ú®:globe_with_meridians:

<br />

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a decade of experience in reinforcement learning, predictive analytics, and algorithmic efficiency for cloud computing. 

I care about the human-centered management of data-driven systems, helping people build data ecosystems that make sense, and solving hard problems through the clever use of math.

### üåç I founded Gadfly.ai
We are a community of coders sharing curated resources on responsible cloud computing, sharing resources and best practices to reduce the carbon footprint distributed cloud computing. As founder, my focus is in advising scaling architecture and a global perspective on the full energy lifecycle of distributed computing systems.

### 	:octocat: Looking for a mentor in tech? 

Looking to expand your career in data science? I love working with people who are passionate about building a better world, one git commit at a time. I train a highly selective cohort of technical talent with a ***real passion for working at the intersection of activism + computing***.
