I'm also the leader of **[Gadfly](https://gadfly.ai/about_us)**, a collective of Open Source artists and creatives engaged in exciting projects that range from [Media Analysis of Security Vulnerabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zVaFmScKXg&t=20s) to [Understanding Hardware in Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0bdc1uu-jI&t=4s). We explore the intersections of art, technology, and open-source culture to push the boundaries of what's possible.

As a **Technical Community Architect** at the Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC) within the Linux Foundation, I play a pivotal role in the development and implementation of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), addressing critical security challenges across finance, healthcare, and emerging fields like computational justice. I regularly write technical blogs about privacy-enhancing security open-source projects for the [CCC Blog](https://confidentialcomputing.io/resources/ccc-blog/).
