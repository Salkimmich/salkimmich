## Hi there, I'm Sara Kimmich 
# :signal_strength:‚ú®:earth_americas:‚ú®:computer:‚ú®:globe_with_meridians:

<br />

I am a Senior Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a decade of experience in automated analysis pipelines for reinforcement learning, predictive analytics, and algorithmic efficiency for cloud computing. I build data-driven design processes to reduce cognitive and algorithmic bias in machine learning design.  üëã

:bulb: ***I‚Äôm currently building an open source data science training program at the intersection of activism + computing, and I'm really excited about it*** :bulb: <br /><br />
:busts_in_silhouette: I‚Äôm looking to collaborate with other coding content creators who care about making the world a better place <br />
:thought_balloon: I‚Äôm looking for help with community building and engagement <br />
:ferris_wheel: Pronouns: They/Them or She/Her <br />

### üåç I founded Gadfly.ai
We are a community of coders sharing curated resources on responsible cloud computing, sharing resources and best practices to reduce the carbon footprint distributed cloud computing. As founder, my focus is in advising scaling architecture and a global perspective on the full energy lifecycle of distributed computing systems.

### 	:octocat: Looking for a mentor in tech? 

Looking to expand your career in data science? I love working with people who are passionate about building a better world, one git commit at a time. I train a highly selective cohort of technical talent with a ***real passion for working at the intersection of activism + computing***. If that's you, I'd love to have you join our final FLIK cohort of the year October 1st 2020!
